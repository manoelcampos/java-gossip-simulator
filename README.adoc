# Java Gossip Protocol Simulator API image:https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/manoelcampos/java-gossip-simulator/maven[GitHub Workflow Status]

An experimental Java API to enable simulating the spread of data
across nodes (Hosts) in a network using the Gossip Protocol.

The API enables running the simulation using a single computer.
Every node is represented by a Plain Old Java Object `GossipNode`.
Therefore, since this is a simulation API, there is no actual
network communication.

for some utilization examples.
