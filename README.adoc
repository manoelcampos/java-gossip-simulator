= Java Gossip Protocol Simulator API image:https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/manoelcampos/java-gossip-simulator/maven[GitHub Workflow Status]

An experimental Java API to enable simulating the dissemination of data
across nodes (Hosts) in a network using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol[Gossip epidemic protocol].

The API enables running the simulation using a single computer.
Every node is represented by a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object[Plain Old Java Object] `GossipNode`.
Therefore, since this is a simulation API, there is no actual
network communication, not even in localhost.

== Examples

The figure below shows an example of the output for a simulation cycle,
where nodes send a message to their neighbours.
An infected node üêû is that one which has already received a message,
otherwise it's a non-infected node üíö.
