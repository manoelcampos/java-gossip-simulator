# Java Gossip Protocol Simulator API

An experimental Java API to enable simulating the spread of data
across nodes (Hosts) in a network using the Gossip Protocol.

The API enables running the simulation using a single computer.
Every node is represented by a Plain Old Java Object `GossipNode`.
Therefore, since this is a simulation API, there is no actual
network communication.
